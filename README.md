# Ece2312 Project 1
As part of Project 1, we were responsible for writing code to record, save, and analyze audio files. Using attenuation and delay techniques, we tested strategies for adjusting the apparent direction of stereo audio files.
Included is code for recording and saving our audio files, generating stereo files from mono recordings, and delaying and/or attenuating the generated stereo files.
